The provided Azure Function code listens for Event Grid triggers and processes password-protected zip files stored in Azure Blob Storage. Below is an explanation of key components and how the code works:

Service Principal & Authentication:

The function authenticates using Azure's ClientSecretCredential, which uses the provided tenant ID, client ID, and client secret to connect to Azure Blob Storage and Key Vault.
Blob Storage & Key Vault Integration:

The Blob Storage client (BlobServiceClient) is used to interact with the blobs, while SecretClient from Key Vault retrieves the password for the zip files.
Event Grid Trigger:

The function triggers upon receiving an Event Grid event. The event data contains the URL of the blob that was added or modified.
Zip File Handling:

The function checks if the blob is a zip file and then attempts to extract it using pyzipper, which supports AES-encrypted zip files.
The password is retrieved from Azure Key Vault to unlock the zip file.
Extracting Files:

Once the correct password is used, files inside the zip are extracted and uploaded to an extracted/input_files/ folder within the same container.
Archiving the Processed Zip:

The processed zip file is moved to an archived/ folder by starting a copy operation.
